# Assessment of Data Sources and Solar Irradiation Satellite Estimation Models for Rural Villages in the Colombian Amazon

The project focuses on evaluating the accuracy and reliability of solar irradiation estimation models and data sources for rural villages in the Colombian Amazon. By comparing satellite-based models with ground-based measurements from IDEAM stations, the study aims to assess the suitability of these models for solar energy planning in remote, underserved areas. The findings provide valuable insights for improving energy access through solar solutions in the region.
